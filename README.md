## üì¶ Setting up Airtable

First, let‚Äôs set up our Airtable. 

1. Create an account in Airtable. 
2. Create a base with the fields: Email (Email), and Approved (Checkbox). Rename the table to ‚ÄúRegistration.‚Äù

<br />

3. Create a Personal access token to authenticate API requests. Click on your account profile ‚Üí Developer Hub ‚Üí Create Personal access token with the following settings.

<br />

<br />

4. Once the token is created, save it somewhere securely because we will need it for later. 
5. We will need to use Airtable‚Äôs web API. To get familiar make sure to check out the Airtable web api documentation. In the API reference, select the Waitlist Base that we created. The API reference will also show you your Airtable base (highlighted in the image below). Be sure to copy that base somewhere because we will be using that when we deploy to Vercel.

<br />

When we deploy to Vercel we will need our Personal access token and the Airtable base id. 
Now let‚Äôs set up our Descope Project. 

## üöÄ Deploy to Vercel 

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdescope-sample-apps%2Fwaitlist-sample-app&env=REACT_APP_PROJECT_ID,AIRTABLE_BASE,PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN)

> **_NOTE:_** When you deploy to Vercel, there will be errors because we did not create our Descope flow yet. Learn more about how we build the flow in the [blog](https://www.descope.com/blog/post/waitlist-app-airtable).
